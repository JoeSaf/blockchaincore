# Blockchain P2P File Storage System - Development Plan

## 3-Week Sprint Timeline

### Week 1: Core Security & File Storage
**Days 1-2: Enhanced Security System**
- Implement corrupted block detection via hash validation
- Add chain integrity verification (previous/next hash validation)
- Create infected block isolation system
- Build automatic user data migration to clean chain

**Days 3-4: File Storage Blockchain Adaptation**
- Modify blockchain to handle file data
- Implement file chunking and reconstruction
- Add file metadata tracking
- Create file integrity verification

**Days 5-7: Polymorphic Chain Reordering**
- Design chain reordering algorithm to prevent brute force
- Implement randomized block ordering with integrity preservation
- Add reordering triggers and recovery mechanisms

### Week 2: P2P Enhancement & CLI
**Days 8-10: Advanced P2P Features**
- Enhance peer discovery and management
- Implement consensus mechanism for infected block detection
- Add network-wide chain validation and recovery
- Create peer trust scoring system

**Days 11-14: CLI Interface Development**
- Build comprehensive command-line interface
- Add real-time security monitoring and alerts
- Implement all blockchain operations via CLI
- Create interactive chain status display

### Week 3: Web Interface & Integration
**Days 15-17: Simple Web Interface**
- Create basic HTML pages for user interaction
- Implement user registration and authentication
- Build file upload system with user validation
- Add chain viewing capabilities

**Days 18-21: Final Integration & Testing**
- Integrate all components
- Comprehensive testing with multiple nodes
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and deployment preparation

## Key Implementation Priorities

### 1. Security Features (High Priority)
```cpp
class SecurityManager {
    // Corrupted block detection
    bool detectCorruptedBlocks();
    // Chain integrity verification
    bool verifyChainIntegrity();
    // Infected block isolation
    void quarantineInfectedBlocks();
    // Data migration to clean chain
    void migrateUserData();
};
```

### 2. File Storage Adaptation (High Priority)
```cpp
class FileBlock : public Block {
    struct FileData {
        std::string filename;
        std::vector<uint8_t> data;
        std::string fileHash;
        size_t chunkIndex;
        size_t totalChunks;
    };
};
```

### 3. Polymorphic Chain Reordering (Medium Priority)
```cpp
class ChainReorderer {
    void reorderChain();
    void validateReorderedChain();
    void triggerReorderEvent();
};
```

### 4. CLI Interface (High Priority)
```bash
./blockchain_cli mine
./blockchain_cli status --security
./blockchain_cli upload-file <filename>
./blockchain_cli peers --list
./blockchain_cli chain --validate
```

### 5. Web Interface (Medium Priority)
- Simple login page
- File upload form
- Chain explorer
- Basic user dashboard

## Current Codebase Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured C++ implementation
- Good separation of concerns
- Comprehensive blockchain fundamentals
- Professional logging and error handling
- Strong cryptographic foundation

**Needs Enhancement:**
- P2P network needs consensus mechanisms
- Blockchain needs file storage adaptation
- Missing CLI interface entirely
- No web interface implementation
- Security features need enhancement

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Security Manager** - This is your most innovative feature
2. **Adapt Blockchain for Files** - Core functionality for your use case
3. **Build CLI Interface** - Primary user interaction method
4. **Enhance P2P Networking** - Add consensus and recovery
5. **Create Simple Web UI** - Secondary interface
