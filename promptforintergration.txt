"I have a blockchain database system with a Django dashboard that's currently working for login/logout. I need help integrating several components:
Current Setup:

Django dashboard with working authentication
Python CLI system with system_coordinator.py (connects C++ node to Python CLI)
Blockchain database with file storage and security scanning
Command-line interface for database operations

Goals for Integration:

Data Upload via Dashboard: Move file upload functionality from command-line to web interface with progress indicators and validation
Security & Logging Dashboard: Display security warnings, scan results, and activity logs in the web interface instead of just command-line output
Unified Startup Script: Create a script that launches both:

python system_coordinator.py (CLI/node connector)
python manage.py runserver (Django dashboard)
And properly coordinates them



What I'll Upload:

system_coordinator.py (the main connector)
All relevant Django files (views, models, templates)
CLI interface files
Database structure files
Any security/logging modules

Questions:

Best architecture for unified startup (single script vs process manager vs Docker?)
How to share data between CLI system and Django dashboard
Real-time updates from CLI to dashboard
Process communication strategies

Please help me design and implement this integrated system."
