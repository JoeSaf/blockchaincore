Hey Claude, I’m reuploading code that was previously generated by you, but I noticed that some functions are either missing or incomplete.
I only need you to help regenerate or complete the missing function implementations — **please don’t regenerate or rewrite the entire codebase**. I want to go function-by-function to ensure accuracy and avoid unnecessary changes.
When I share a specific function name or incomplete function block, just return the **full and complete implementation of that one function only** — nothing more, nothing less.
the file we are going to work on is system_coordinator.py
Please wait for me to give you the next function. Let’s work through them one at a time.

lets start with category database managenent: implement the code for manage_databse_security, for any object created under this, implement them too dont leave call out skeletons
