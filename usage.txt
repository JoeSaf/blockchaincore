"I need you to create the complete C++ implementation files (.cpp) for a blockchain file storage system. I have the header files already, and I need you to create full working implementations for:
1. SecurityManager.cpp - Advanced security system with:

Corrupted block detection via hash validation
Chain integrity verification
Automatic infected block quarantine
Polymorphic chain reordering (anti-brute force)
User data migration to clean chains
Real-time threat monitoring

2. FileBlockchain.cpp - File storage blockchain with:

File chunking and reconstruction
File deduplication and compression
Permission management system
Integrity verification with SHA-256
File upload/download operations
UTXO-style file tracking

3. WebInterface.cpp - Web interface with:

User authentication (login/register)
File upload via HTTP with drag-and-drop support
File download and management
Blockchain explorer interface
Security dashboard with real-time monitoring
Simple HTTP server using cpp-httplib

Requirements:

Use modern C++17 features
Include comprehensive error handling
Add detailed logging with spdlog
Thread-safe implementations with mutexes
JSON serialization with nlohmann/json
Integration with existing Blockchain, P2PNetwork, and Transaction classes
Professional code quality with proper documentation

Please create complete, production-ready implementations that work together as a cohesive blockchain file storage system."
